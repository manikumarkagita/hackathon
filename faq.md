Talk to the staff who are willing to take part for the same problem statement and goto <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}{% link registration.md %}" style="color:yellow"><b>Registration</b></a> page to signup the team.

<h3><b>How many team members can have in a team?</b></h3>
Maximum of 4 members per team can participate in DNB Hackathon.

<br>

<h3><b>What should I focus on for the Hackathon event?</b></h3>
You have two weeks to tackle the problem you selected and then we need from you a clear description of your solution where it is important that you tackle:
<div>
  <ul>
    <li>Problem statement.</li>
    <li>Clear description of your solution.</li>
    <li>To what extent is the solution fully covered in your response and what still needs more work: Getting a solution as complete as possible is of course important.</li>
    <li>Do think out of the box since that can lead to unexpected and very good answers.</li>
    <li>What effort (manpower / funding) is still needed to make this an implementable solution.</li>
    <li>What makes your solution the best one.</li>
  </ul>
</div>
