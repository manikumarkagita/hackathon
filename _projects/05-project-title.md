title: 5G based cameras image collection as input for advanced AI-Machine Vision
---

Under 5G, the need for Machine Vision modelling will explode given the large increase in image data being collected (from many different types of cameras) and for that reason we need to look for good quality Open Source Machine Vision software (either edge or cloud based) making it easier and faster to analyse this image data for predefined errors, use cases, etc.


<b>Solution Requirement:</b> 
Therefore, we do look for Open-Source solutions picking up the image data from cameras, applying AI-MV models, presenting the results, and of course supporting further development of these models until the model meets the required levels. Select the AI-MV Open-Source software such that it can be selected for a broad spectrum of use cases, accessible to the Small to Medium based companies to solve their related problems and IT (startup) companies to bring this solution to the market.  Given the availability of 5G, do look at using this software at the edge since then 5G low latency for real time MV analysis and advice is of importance. Provide the solution proposal and an example of how the suggested solutions is applied on any of the digital services.
