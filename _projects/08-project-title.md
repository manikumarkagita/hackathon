Sustainability with lesser environmental impact is an important topic for Industrial 5.0 evolution. For example, green manufacturing focuses on using the potential of automated processes such as 5G realtime quality assurance, preventative maintenance in reducing leakage, machine learning quality inspection in creating less material waste, remote expert AR assistance in reducing the travelling, factory environment data collection in identifying the weak point for continuous sustainability improvement. With the assisted AI technology and apps, it can help to provide an aggregated insight across the manufacturing process chain to optimize the environment impact and profitability.


<b>Solution Requirement:</b>
To support the improvement actions and initiative decision making, develop a Green Manufacturing Monitoring Applications (Visual Tool) with suggested metrics and provide the solution on how to collect the data for comparison between the actual performance and set targets. Also, identify the solution that requires 5G components.
